the algorithm for finding the roots of equation

# for a quadratic equation
DISPLAY "Enter the value for a: "
DISPLAY "Enter the value for b: "
DISPLAY "Enter the value for c: "
x1 = (-b + (b **2 - 4ac) ** 0.5) / 2a
x2 = (-b - (b ** 2 - 4ac) ** 0.5) / 2a
PRINT "The roots of the equation are x1 and x2"
